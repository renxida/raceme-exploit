rax = size
rdx = size + 15
rax = 15
rax = size + 30
rax = size + 30 / 16
rax = size + 30 (aligned to 16)

rax = (rsp - [size+30(aligned down to 16)]) rounded up to nearest 16
loc = rbp - rax




idea: use buffer overflow to overwrite stream, thread_id, buffer, stack_cookie, rbp_new, s, r;

what is the argument to thread creation?
